# Beanie-Bandit

Javascript game where beanies need to be caught and visors must be avoided.

## Where Did All These Beanies and Visors Come From?

Thanks to global warming (aka climate change) beanies are falling from the sky. It just so happens the Beanie Bandit is in town and they want as many beanies as possible.

Another side effect of climate change (arguably the worst side effect) is visors raining from the sky. Beanie Bandit despises visors! Why make a hat with no head covering?!? Beanie Bandit must avoid the falling visors at all costs!

## Game Explanation

### Objective

Collect as many beanies as possible in the alloted time while avoiding the visors! Three visor grabs and the game is over!
The player can move horizontally to catch the beanies and dodge the visors as they are falling from the ever-warming sky!

## MVP

- Implement staggered/random beanies and visors falling down screen
- Implement game score that increments when beanies collide with player and decrement when visors collide with player
- Have player move horizontally to collect and dodge beanies and visors respectively
- Implement game countdown
- Implement visors collided display on-screen and end game when player hits three visors
- Implement new game / reset button

## Stretch Goals

- Have random beanie images instead of 1 beanie image
- Horizontal moving enemies at bottom of screen that player must jump or crouch to dodge
- Powerup 'special' beanies and powerdown 'special' visors
- Dyamic background that changes from blue to red as timer counts down
